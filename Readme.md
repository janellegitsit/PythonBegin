## About This Repository

This repository contains the very first Python programs I’ve ever written (on 12/4/24) as I began my programming journey. They are the answers to the questions for my course evaluation in the fundamentals of python programming (@ Eastern university). While these programs may not always be the most efficient or optimized, and they may lack error-handling, as well as user-friendly prompts, they represent the coding that I was capable of after about 30 hours of study.

I created this repository to:
- Showcase my starting point in programming.
- Highlight the concepts and skills I’ve learned, including lists, dictionaries, loops, and basic algorithms.
- Serve as a baseline for tracking my growth as a programmer.

As I continue learning, I plan to update this repository with more advanced and optimized versions of these programs.
